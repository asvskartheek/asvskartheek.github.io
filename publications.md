In this paper, we address the task of improving pair-wise machine translation for specific low resource Indian languages. Multilingual NMT models have demonstrated a reasonable amount of effectiveness on resource-poor languages. In this work, we show that the performance of these models can be significantly improved upon by using back-translation through a filtered back-translation process and subsequent fine-tuning on the limited pair-wise language corpora. The analysis in this paper suggests that this method can significantly improve a multilingual model's performance over its baseline, yielding state-of-the-art results for various Indian languages.

Understanding dynamic behavior of computer programs during normal working conditions is an important task, which has multiple security benefits such as development of a behavior-based anomaly detection, vulnerability discovery and patching. Existing works achieved this goal by collecting and analyzing various data including network traffic, system calls, instruction traces, etc. In this paper, we explore the use of a new type of data, performance counters, to analyze dynamic behavior of programs. Using existing primitives, we develop a tool named \texttt{perfextract} to capture data from different performance counters for a program during its startup time, thus forming multiple time series to represent the dynamic behavior of the program. We analyze the collected data and develop a clustering algorithm that allows us to classify each program using its performance counter time series into a specific group and to identify the intrinsic behavior of that group. We carry out extensive experiments with $18$ real world programs that belong to $4$ groups including web browsers, text editors, image viewers and audio players. The experimental results show that the examined programs can be accurately differentiated based on their performance counter data regardless whether programs are run in physical or virtual environments.
